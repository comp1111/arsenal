            <p>Although Aidan was born in Manila, Philippines, he lived most his life in Orange County in Southern California. 
                In addition to playing guitar and gaming, he loves computers. This is why he joined the Computing Department
                at BCIT where he hopes to graduate with a Diploma in 2020. The area in Computing that Aidan is  
                most passionate about is undecided, but he hopes to find one. Needless to say, Aidan's favorite course is COMP1111.</p>
