            <p>Stephen was born in Burnaby, BC, and lived most of his life in the city of Vancouver. 
                In addition to sushi and pizza, he likes computers (not as food). This is why he joined CST
                at BCIT where he hopes to graduate with a Diploma in 2020. The area in Computing that Stephen is  
                most passionate about is yet to be discovered. Needless to say, Stephen's favorite course is COMP1111.</p>
