            <p>Zach was born and raised in the lower mainland. He grew up in Langley playing hockey and spending a little too much time on the computer. Zach enjoys playing video games, working out, and spending time with his girlfriend, friends, and family. Some day Zach hopes to have a good job and own a nice home. His favourite class in the program is, of course, Comp 1111 with Carly! </p>
