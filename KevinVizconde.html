          <p>Kevin Vizconde was born in the Philippines.<p>Kevin was so eager to see the world that he rushed out of his mother before they could get to the hospital; thus, he was born inside the tiny home his parents built. <p>Kevin is the youngest child of Mr. and Mrs. Vizconde, he has one older sister. When Kevin was about a year old, his sister was pushing him in his stroller until one of the stroller's wheel hit a curb and the stroller flipped over while Kevin fell face first on concrete which gave him a deviated septum and an uneven nostril. Kevin was very prone to accidents when he was young.
              
               <p>Despite his misfortunes, Kevin still loves life...especially when he has a bottle of rum. </p>
